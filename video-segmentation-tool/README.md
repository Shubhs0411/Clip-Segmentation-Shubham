# Video Segmentation Tool

The goal of this project is to develop a video segmentation tool that can take a long video as input and generate smaller clips based on specified filters or criteria. The tool should leverage computer vision and audio analysis techniques to identify relevant segments within the video.

## Task Overview

You are tasked with designing and implementing a video segmentation pipeline that includes the following components:

**Shot Boundary Detection**:
   - Develop algorithms or techniques to detect transitions between shots or scenes in the video, such as comparing histogram differences or edge changes between consecutive frames.
   - Implement shot boundary detection to identify potential points in the video where a new clip could begin or end.

**Filtering and Segmentation**:
   - Develop algorithms or rule-based systems to determine clip boundaries based on the content analysis results and desired filters or criteria.
   - Implement logic to extract the identified video segments and generate individual clips, including encoding, metadata embedding, and clip organization.

## Requirements

- Proficiency in Python programming language and familiarity with computer vision and machine learning libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Experience with video processing techniques and libraries.
- Knowledge of object detection, scene recognition, and other relevant computer vision tasks.
- Understanding of audio processing and analysis techniques (optional, depending on the desired features).
- Familiarity with GUI development using Python libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython.
- Strong software engineering skills, including version control, testing, and deployment practices.

## Deliverables

1. A well-documented and modular codebase for the video segmentation tool.
2. A user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the tool.
3. Comprehensive test suites and documentation.
4. A deployment package or instructions for deploying the application or service.
5. A project report detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of the video segmentation pipeline.
