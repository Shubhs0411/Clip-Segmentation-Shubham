# Video Segmentation Tool

The Video Segmentation Tool is a Python-based application designed to segment long videos into smaller clips based on shot boundaries. Leveraging computer vision techniques, the tool detects transitions between shots and extracts relevant segments from the input video. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for interaction, enabling users to select input video files, specify output directories, and segment videos effortlessly.

## Getting Started

To use the Video Segmentation Tool, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `tkinter`, `moviepy`.

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy moviepy
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd video-segmentation-tool
```

3. Navigate to the `dist` directory:

```bash
cd dist
```

4. Enter the `Video_Segmentation_Tool` folder:

```bash
cd Video_Segmentation_Tool
```

### Usage

1. Open the `Video_Segmentation_Tool.exe` file located in the `dist/Video_Segmentation_Tool` directory.

2. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the Video Segmentation Tool will open.

3. Use the GUI to perform the following actions:
   - Click on "Select Video File" to choose the input video file you want to segment.
   - Click on "Select Output Directory" to choose the directory where the segmented video clips will be saved.
   - Once both the video file and output directory are selected, click on "Segment Video" to start the segmentation process.
   - Upon completion, a message will appear indicating the success of the segmentation process.
